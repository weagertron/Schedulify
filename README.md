# Schedulify
React native Spotify playlist creator

## How it works
Create a list of artists that you like and select whether you want the app to select that artist's top songs or x number of random songs.
Generating the playlist will create a playlist within Spotify consisting of these parameters.

### TODO
- Make it so the playlist creation can be scheduled and automatically generated in the background
- Rewrite using flutter
